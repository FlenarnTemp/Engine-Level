## Understanding the Code

The main entry point of the plugin is the `F4SEPlugin_Load` function. This function initializes the plugin, registers the messaging and scaleform interfaces, and installs the dialogue menu, patches, and scripts.

The `F4SE::AllocTrampoline` function is used to allocate memory for the plugin.

The `RE::Cascadia::CAS_DialogueMenu::Install` function installs the dialogue menu.

The `RE::Cascadia::Patches::Install` function installs the patches.

The `ObScript::Install` function installs the scripts.
